Companion code to go along with my blog post introducing users to creating snaps from archive packages: https://larry-price.com/blog/2016/12/07/creating-a-snap-from-existing-deb-packages/

Just run `snapcraft` and then `snap install` the rest (probably in devmode). You can now run pingus with the command `pingus`.
